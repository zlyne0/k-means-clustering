### Example of k-means clustering algorithm.

Using 2D points visualized by libgdx library, each cluster painted by own color.

Main algorithm implemented by class KCluster allow to use in any problem space 
by implement interface ElementOperations, Centroid
Implementation allow to space point be immutable. 
For performance reason centroid is not immutable.  

### How to run?
```
./gradlew run
```
